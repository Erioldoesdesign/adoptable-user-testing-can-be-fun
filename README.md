# User testing can be fun: An FAQ - Interactive guide

User testing can be fun is the first resource of five created by the team at [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/) for OSS tool teams about design.

USABLE resources focus on supporting maintainers of OSS, developer contributors and OSS tool teams to better understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

USABLE is a collaboration between [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/), [Okthanks](https://okthanks.com/) and [Internews](https://internews.org/) looking to build resources for OSS tool teams to help them understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.
This resource focuses on user testing  and how it can be fun as well as informative and useful for OSS tool team.s. We built 'user testing can be fun' as an interactive clickable 'game' (created in [Twine](https://twinery.org/) thanks Twine! using [SugarCube](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/)) so you can follow through with our coder squirrel Hex as they learn all about user testing.

You can play the guide/FAQ/game in your browser locally or on Adoptables' [itch.io page here](https://adoptable.itch.io/user-testing-can-be-fun-a-guide-for-oss-developers-and-tool-teams-on-how-to-user).

You can fork this repo and make changes to the game and use any of the images and content here - it's free and open source :)

If you want to contribute a PR to improve the game or log a bug with the game you can do that by [raising a Pull Request](https://github.com/simplysecure/adoptable-user-testing-can-be-fun/pulls) and [opening an issue](https://github.com/simplysecure/adoptable-user-testing-can-be-fun/issues)

--- 

We also have a poster version of this resource! unlike a repository of code where you can fork, clone, edit, play and submit improvements via issues and PR's to the games code the poster version can be iterated on and collaborated on in a similar way through using an open ['PenPot'](https://penpot.app/) file and then through uploading a 'finished' version of your remixed poster via a pull request to our [repository for the 'Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ' poster](https://github.com/simplysecure/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun-poster).
